## Projects

1. Technical University of Munich - Text Complexity Control - independently developed - 202303-202309
    * Goal: Develop a strategy to control the output text complexity of the language model.
    * Techniques: RLHF, Adapter-Based Tuning
    * Challenges: Data and Computation Resource Scarcity, Lack of Adapter Fusion Framework
    * Results:
      
      (1) Develop a less resource-intensive training strategy.
      
      (2) Offline control via different types of reward models.
      
      (3) Online Control via multiple adapter modules and learnable control tokens.
      
      (4) Develop a learnable weighting strategy for LoRA adapters.

2. Technical University of Munich - Visualizing Text Alignments - independently developed - 202210-202304
    * Goal: Align the content of the source-target texts and detect inconsistency including missing, wrong, and hallucinated information.
    * Techniques: Attention Visualization, PhraseBERT
    * Challenges: Attention weights tend to concentrate on special tokens e.g. punctuations and eos tokens, which leads to trivial alignments.
    * Results:

      (1) Integrate the function of outputting the weighted value vector norm matrix into the transformer library fork.

      (2) Dramatically reduce the occurrence of trivial alignments.

      (3) Inconsistency check via phrase-level and word-level alignment.
